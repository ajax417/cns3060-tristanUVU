Project-4
=====================

First come First Serve was notably the worst in terms of total traversal. Shortest Seek Time was the best, at worst it ties with Scan-Look but it usually would beat out Scan-Look. Scan-Look can either perform well or really poorly, just depending on how well suited the data is for sorting in that way.
