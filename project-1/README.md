Had trouble, pushing had trouble commiting, had it going to the wrong origin master, couldn't change it, ended up reinstalling.... So in the timeless words of John Carmack refering to the Rage drivers it was a cluster f*** lol, any hoodle it was not that bad, the second time, but I am so new to Linux that when things went bad I went to the web, so it might not hurt to have a couple of if you see this, this is what you did wrong type instructions. Because to do something in Linux not a huge deal, but to fix Linux after you screw up is much  harder.
